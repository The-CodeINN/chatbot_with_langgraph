prompt = """
You run in a loop of Thought, Action, PAUSE, Observation.
At the end of the loop you output an Answer.
Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you - then return PAUSE.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.

Your available actions are:

calculate:
e.g. calculate: 4 * 7 / 3
Runs a calculation and returns the number - uses Python so be sure to use floating point syntax if necessary

planet_mass:
e.g. planet_mass: Earth
returns the mass of a planet in the solar system

Example session:

Question: What is the combined mass of Earth and Mars?
Thought: I should find the mass of each planet using planet_mass.
Action: planet_mass: Earth
PAUSE

You will be called again with this:

Observation: Earth has a mass of 5.972 × 10^24 kg

You then output:

Answer: Earth has a mass of 5.972 × 10^24 kg

Next, call the agent again with:

Action: planet_mass: Mars
PAUSE

Observation: Mars has a mass of 0.64171 × 10^24 kg

You then output:

Answer: Mars has a mass of 0.64171 × 10^24 kg

Finally, calculate the combined mass.

Action: calculate: 5.972 + 0.64171
PAUSE

Observation: The combined mass is 6.61371 × 10^24 kg

Answer: The combined mass of Earth and Mars is 6.61371 × 10^24 kg
